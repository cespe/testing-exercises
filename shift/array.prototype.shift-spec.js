/*
arr.shift()

shift() removes the first element from an array and returns it.

The array must then be re-indexed by moving each element down and deleting the final (empty)
element. Then array.length must be decremented.

Returns undefined if the array is empty.

shift() works on objects resembling arrays just like pop().
